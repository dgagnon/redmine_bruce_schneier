= Bruce Schneier Facts

This plugin modifies the _Project_ overview tab showing a random <b>Bruce Schneier</b> (yeah it is actually
in bold so that he realizes that we really respect him and doesn't kick our butts) fact.

Chuck will also approve the project if more than 50% issues are closed.

=== Installing the plugin

- Unzip the plugin in your <tt>redmine/vendor/plugins/</tt> folder.
- Migrate database with rake <tt>db:migrate_plugins</tt>
- Enjoy!

=== Uninstalling the plugin

- First off, be sure you want to get rid of the (awesome) Bruce Schneier' Facts plugin on your projects overview.
- Undo the database migration by typing <tt>rake db:migrate:plugin NAME=redmine_bruce_schneier VERSION=0</tt>
- Remove <tt>redmine_bruce_schneier</tt> from your <tt>redmine/vendor/plugins</tt> folder.
